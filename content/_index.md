description1 = """
**Kubirds** is a powerful and flexible **Cloud-Native framework to operate your
supervision**, allowing developers and operators to **observe and react to events
in their infrastructure** across cloud providers and on-premise systems.

**[Get started with the installation guide.](/getting-started/)**
"""

description2 = """
Encapsulate your workflow in **Docker images** and **reuse them heavily** in
any job. Kubirds' reactivity is **Plug'n'play**, allowing you to **attach,
update and remove** your automated incident-response workflow **without**
interfering with your observability workflow.

**[Learn more about this in our tutorials.](/docs/dockerized-supervision/)**
