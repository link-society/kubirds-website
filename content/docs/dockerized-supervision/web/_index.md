# Introduction

> It is recommended to first read the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide before continuing this article.

In this tutorial, you will learn to setup the monitoring of your web service using Kubirds' declarative configuration.

 - notify your team when the service is unavailable (ie: via Slack)
 - plan time windows where monitoring is unneeded (ie: during an upgrade)
